# **Model Evaluation and Clustering Visualization**

This repository contains a Shiny web application for evaluating machine learning models and visualizing clustering results. The app provides an interactive platform to upload datasets, preprocess data, and generate various evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and visualizations.


## **Features**

### **Data Handling**
- Upload CSV datasets for analysis.
- Preprocesses data by focusing on key audio features:
  - **Danceability**, **Energy**, **Loudness**, **Speechiness**, **Acousticness**, **Instrumentalness**, **Liveness**, **Valence**, **Tempo**, and **official_video** (target column with `True` or `False` values).

### **Machine Learning Models**
- Implements multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Naive Bayes**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **K-Means Clustering**

### **Outputs**
- **Confusion Matrices**: Visualize model predictions against true labels.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Includes **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **Error Rate** for each model.
- **ROC Curve Plots**: Displayed for **Naive Bayes** and **Decision Tree** models.
- **Clustering Visualization**: View K-Means clustering results with color-coded clusters.

## **Dataset Requirements**

- Upload a **CSV file** containing the following columns:
  - Key features: **Danceability**, **Energy**, **Loudness**, **Speechiness**, **Acousticness**, **Instrumentalness**, **Liveness**, **Valence**, **Tempo**.
  - Target variable: **official_video** (`True`/`False`).

- Ensure the dataset has no missing values.

## **Technologies Used**

- **R programming** for data processing and model training.
- **Shiny** for building the interactive application.
- **caret**, **naivebayes**, **e1071**, **rpart** for machine learning.
- **ggplot2**, **gridExtra** for data visualizations.
- **pROC** for ROC curve analysis.

## **Conclusion**

This Shiny application demonstrates the practical implementation of machine learning techniques for classification and clustering tasks. By using this app, users can:

1. **Evaluate Machine Learning Models**  
   - Gain insights into how different models perform on a dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and error rate.
   - Compare confusion matrices and visualize ROC curves to identify model strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Analyze Clustering Results**  
   - Leverage K-Means clustering to uncover patterns or groupings in the data.  
   - Visualize clusters based on key audio features, providing deeper insights into dataset structure.

3. **Practical Applications**  
   - This tool can be applied in domains such as **music analysis**, **media streaming**, or **marketing** to classify content (e.g., official vs. non-official videos) or identify similar clusters of audio features.  
   - Businesses can use it to make data-driven decisions, such as targeting specific audiences or optimizing music recommendation systems.

4. **Educational and Prototyping Use**  
   - The app provides a hands-on learning platform for individuals exploring machine learning concepts.  
   - It can be a prototype for developing more advanced analytical tools or dashboards for real-world datasets.

### **Why Implement This?**
- Machine learning is essential for making data-driven predictions and extracting meaningful insights from data. This application bridges the gap between raw datasets and actionable analytics by integrating:
  - Supervised learning for accurate predictions.
  - Clustering to discover hidden patterns.
- By offering a user-friendly interface, the app ensures that both technical and non-technical users can interact with machine learning models without deep programming knowledge.

This repository serves as a stepping stone for exploring and implementing machine learning techniques in diverse domains, making it a valuable tool for both data scientists and domain professionals.
